<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Just a little work around, to make your admin and latepoint admin roles separate, as they may sometimes need to be.

Here's why:
* Separate website administration with latepoint reception admin capability.
* The receptionist may not have control over the full website.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With

* [PHP]
